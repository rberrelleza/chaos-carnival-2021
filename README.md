# Bring Chaos into your Development Environment 

Companion repository to the talk I gave as part of [Chaos Carnival 2021](https://chaoscarnival.io/agenda).

[The recording is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3No4-1H6slc).


# Five tips for bringing chaos into your development environments

## Tip #1

Automatically deploy your application from the repo

## Tip #2
Automatically run your chaos experiments from the repo

## Tip #3
Automatically validate your chaos experiments from the repo, and make it easy to share the results.

## Tip #4
Deploying your application and chaos experiments shouldn't require infra knowledge. It should be a button or a single script.

## Tip #5
If going to Kubernetes, don't force your developers to run a cluster each.

## Bonus round
Get realistic data in your development environments. It's hard, don't start here, but do it.
